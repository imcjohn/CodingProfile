A few python snippets that I wrote during my Freshman fall at MIT for 6.02 (Introduction to EECS II: Digital Communication Systems)

block.py - A linear block encoder and Syndrome decoder
lzw.py - An implementation of the lzw compression algorithm, and a decompression function for lzw-compressed files
viterbi.py - A convolutional encoder, and Viterbi decoder
