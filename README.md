# CodingProfile
I made this profile pretty early on in my college career, it has a few projects from back in the day. At this point, it's mostly for posterity that I keep it up, so if you'd like a more full overview of my current coding capabilities I'd strongly recommend taking a look at some of my newer projects too!

## Course Selection
My senior year of High School, I wrote a sorter program to sort the various students into their respective English classes. The entire program is in this folder. The most interesting file to look at is probably Junior_English_Sorter.py. If you want to test it, just run this file on Python 3 (with TKinter installed), and select sample.csv as the data to use.

## Python Snippets
A few short python programs I wrote for EECS Classes at MIT, detailing various compression and channel encoding algorithms.

## Jane Street Electronic Trading Competition (Jane Street ETC)
Trading bot created at the Jane Street ETC by me and my two teammates, written in C++. More details in the folder

## TinyBasic in C++ (Tiny Basic CPP)
Tiny basic interpreter written by me in C++. Still adding more features, but fully implements the language spec as of now.
